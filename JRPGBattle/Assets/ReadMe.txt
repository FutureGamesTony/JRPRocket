MonoCapsule and Capsule is the only hero shapes that have been worked on.
Attack is the only function in the game. As time grow short and I have a 
lot to do, I did the rest more as a concept or for further development in 
later. 
This is a very rushed job, regardless of what is pressed it will attack 
EnemyCapsule. 
The BattleActions also lacks the option to add a hero.
